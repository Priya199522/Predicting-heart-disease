# Predicting-heart-disease
• Collected a heart disease dataset from the web and performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality and consistency.

• Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key features and their relationship with heart disease risk using seaborn and matplotlib for visualization.

• Built and evaluated three different machine learning models for prediction:

• Support Vector Machine (SVM)
• Random Forest
• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

• Among the models tested, the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 82.1% in predicting the presence of heart disease.
